# Fungal-Insights-A-Comprehensive-Data-Analysis OR 🍄 Mushroom Edibility Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts whether a mushroom is **edible or poisonous** based on its physical characteristics. It demonstrates the end-to-end data science workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Collected and explored raw mushroom data
- Cleaned the dataset and handled missing/null values
- Visualized key features using **heatmaps** and **bar plots** for better insight
- Encoded categorical features using **Label Encoding**
- Trained and evaluated machine learning models to classify mushroom edibility

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning modeling and evaluation

## 📊 Models Applied

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  

The models were trained on label-encoded data, and the best-performing model achieved **high accuracy** in predicting whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.


## 📈 Results

- Achieved over **97% accuracy** in classification
- Insights into which features most strongly correlate with mushroom toxicity
- Ready for deployment or integration with user-friendly interfaces

## 💡 Use Cases

- Educational tools in mycology
- Early warning systems for foragers
- Demonstration of classification tasks in machine learning
